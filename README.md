# P6-External-Style-Sheet
In this project, you will be creating a two-column webpage just by floating its content. This will allow you to have two columns on your page without needing a table. You may be as creative as you like with this project.


Requirements
Make a layout template that contains a header and two paragraphs (See example below).
Use float to line up the two paragraphs as columns side by side.
In an external style sheet, give the header and two paragraphs a border and/or a background color.
Make a "button" using a div with a link inside it.
Use the external style sheet to give the button:
a border
background color
text color
make the button color change when the user hovers over it.
